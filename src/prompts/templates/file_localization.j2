I have access to a python code repository in the directory {{ instance.repo_path }} . 

Consider the following issue description:

<issue_description>
{{ instance.problem_statement }}
</issue_description>

Act as a code search agent to find the relevant files where we need to make changes so that <issue_description> is met?
NOTE: You do not need to solve the issue, all you need to do is find the relevant files. Your output will be used to guide another agent to solve the issue.

INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Use semantic_search and terminal tools to explore the codebase
2. Identify ALL files that need to be modified to fix this issue
3. Your FINAL response MUST use this exact format:

<file-list>['path/to/file1.py', 'path/to/file2.py', 'path/to/file3.py']</file-list>

CRITICAL:
- Use a Python list format with single quotes
- Use relative paths from repository root (e.g., 'src/module/file.py' not './src/module/file.py')
- Include ALL files that need changes
- Do NOT add explanations after the file list tag

Example of correct final response:
After analyzing the codebase, the files that need modification are:

<file-list>['astropy/modeling/separable.py', 'astropy/modeling/core.py', 'astropy/modeling/tests/test_separable.py']</file-list>

Now find the files that need modification.
